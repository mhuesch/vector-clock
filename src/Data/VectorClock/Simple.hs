-- $example
--
-- To create a vector clock, start from 'empty' and 'insert' elements
-- into it.  As a shortcut, 'fromList' just inserts all the elements
-- in a list, in order.
--
-- > let vc = empty in
-- > let vc' = insert 'a' 1 vc in
-- > let vc'' = insert 'b' 2 vc in
-- > vc'' == fromList [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]
--
-- Note that, /for different keys/, the order of insertion does not
-- matter:
--
-- > fromList [('a', 1), ('b', 2)] == fromList [('b', 2), ('a', 1)]
--
-- Once you have a given vector clock, you can 'lookup' its fields,
-- check that keys are 'member's, or convert it back 'toList' form.
--
-- > lookup 'a' [('a', 1), ('b', 2)] == Just 1
-- > lookup 'c' [('a', 1), ('b', 2)] == Nothing
--
-- The main operations that you would do with a vector clcok are to
-- 'inc'crement the entry corresponding to the current process and to
-- update the process's vector clock with the 'max' of its and the
-- received message's clocks.
--
-- > inc 'a' [('a', 1), ('b', 2)] = Just [('a', 2), ('b', 2)]
-- > max [('a', 1), ('b', 2)] [('c', 3), ('b', 1)] == [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c' 3)]
--
-- Finally, upon receiving different messages, you may wish to
-- discover the 'relation'ship, if any, between them.  This
-- information could be useful in determining the correct order to
-- process the messages.
--
-- > relation (fromList [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]) (fromList [('a', 2), ('b', 2)]) == Causes
-- > relation (fromList [('a', 2), ('b', 2)]) (fromList [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]) == CausedBy
-- > relation (fromList [('a', 2), ('b', 2)]) (fromList [('a', 1), ('b', 3)]) == Concurrent
--
-- In order to send and receive vector clocks, they must first be
-- serialized.  For this purpose, there is a 'Binary' instance for
-- 'VectorClock'.  Additionally, there are 'Data', 'Typeable', and
-- 'Generic' instances, which allow packages such as @cereal@, and
-- @sexp@ to automatically generate serializers and deserializers.

-- | A vector clock is, conceptually, an associtive list sorted by the
-- value of the key, where each key appears only once.
