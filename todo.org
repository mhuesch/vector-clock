vector-clock

* Planned changes
** [/] Big
   - [ ] O(1) everything
   - [ ] Low-level optimised code
** [3/5] Medium
   - [ ] Approximate vector clocks
   - [ ] Bounded vector clocks
   - [X] See what safe Haskell is
   - [X] Tests for all VectorClock functions
   - [X] Test based on changes, rather than fresh VCs
** [3/8]Small
   - [ ] Usage example in README
   - [ ] Usage example in VectorClock
   - [ ] Write down complexity in docs
   - [ ] VectorClock.diff
   - [X] VectorClock.relation
   - [ ] VectorClock.fold2
   - [X] VectorClock.inc
   - [X] Not just maybe; not a good idea
